## 💡 Pro Tips

### For CEO:
1. **Start your day** → Open Order Inbox to see what came in overnight
2. **Use Quick Dispatch Sidebar** for fast assignments (keeps sidebar open)
3. **Check CEO Dashboard** for overall health metrics
4. **Review Order Inbox regularly** to ensure no orders are stuck in Pending

### For Employees:
1. **Bookmark your workspace** → Pin it to favorites
2. **Work directly in workspace** → Don't go to Order_LineItems
3. **Fill BaseCost as you shop** → System auto-calculates profit
4. **Add receipt photos** → Upload to Drive, paste link in ReceiptLink column
5. **Update status** → Keeps CEO informed of progress

### For Field Team:
1. **Use Shopping List** → Groups all items by category (efficient shopping)
2. **Fill BaseCost** → In your workspace or Order_LineItems
3. **Delivery Schedule** → See where to deliver and when

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I can't see my workspace"
- Go to `Menu → Order Workspaces → Open My Workspace`
- Enter your exact name (must match what CEO used)
- System will create it if it doesn't exist

### "Order not showing in inbox"
- Check Order_Headers sheet - what's the Status?
- Order Inbox only shows "Pending" and "Assigned"
- Once status changes to "Shopping" or later, it moves to other views

### "Sidebar won't load orders"
- Click "🔄 Refresh Orders" button
- Check that Order_Headers sheet exists and has data
- Refresh the page (reload Google Sheets)

### "Workspace is too cluttered"
- Only assigned orders should appear in your workspace
- Use `Menu → Archive Completed Workspaces` to clean up
- CEO can reassign orders if needed
